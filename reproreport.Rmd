## R Markdown


<!-- For this week's homework, create your own R markdown file and perform the following tasks: -->

<!--     Update the title with "Homework 12". -->
<!--     Update the author with your name. -->
<!--     Remove all of the pre-populated code chunks and text. -->
<!--     Load the `ggplot2` package, read in the gapminder data and create a plot. -->
<!--     Use chunk options to recreate the same plot with different dimensions. -->
<!--     Add some R code directly into the text of your document. -->
<!--     Export your document as a Word document and as an html document. -->
<!--     Zip these documents into a single zip archive and upload to Blackboard. Documents to include: -->
<!--         Your Rmd file -->
<!--         A Word file -->
<!--         An html file, including any folders with images -->




```{r cars}
summary(gapminder)

gapminder %>%
    filter(year == 2007) %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarise(lifeExp = median(lifeExp), .groups='drop')

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plots, echo=FALSE}

    
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "hotpink") +
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0), alpha = 1/4)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
